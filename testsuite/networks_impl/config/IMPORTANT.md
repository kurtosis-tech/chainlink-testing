NOTE: These files are all copied as-is from the libocr module [here](https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/tree/master/offchainreporting/internal/config)

We have to do this because we need to create the OCR contract configuration, but the function to do so
is private inside the module.

As soon as https://github.com/smartcontractkit/libocr/issues is resolved, we can
delete all this code and go back to using the public methods
